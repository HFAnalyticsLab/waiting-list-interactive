# The Health Foundation Elective Care Waiting List Interactive Calculator

#### Project Status: [In progress]

## Description

This repository includes code for The Health Foundation's [Waiting List Interactive Calculator](https://thehealthfoundation.shinyapps.io/waiting-list-interactive/). Full information on background, context, and methods can be found in the corresponding [article]() and [technical appendix](). 

## Data sources

Data on referrals, completed pathways and the waiting list from April 2016 onward are taken from the [Referral to Treatment (RTT) Waiting Times dataset](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/). Numbers for RTT pathways and waiting list size with estimates for missing values were used.

Data on industrial action is taken from the [Potential industrial action in the NHS webpage](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/preparedness-for-potential-industrial-action-in-the-nhs/). This provides the number of elective procedures and outpatient appointments that were rescheduled as a result of industrial action.

## Requirements

These scripts were written in R version 4.0.2 and RStudio Version 1.1.383. 
Package versions have been tracked using [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). 
All data is publicly available (as described above) and all code is included in this repo, although the app.R script references copyright images and font files which are not publicly available.
